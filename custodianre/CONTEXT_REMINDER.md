# CustodianRe Development Context Reminder

## Project Status: **COMPLETED - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**

### ✅ Recently Completed
1. **Artifact Status Formatting Fix**: Fixed `[p]art status` command markdown issue
   - **Problem**: Asterisks showing instead of bold text in artifact names
   - **Root Cause**: MessageFormatter.create_paginated_embeds wraps content in ```ansi code blocks (line 179)
   - **Solution**: Changed line 2652 from `**{name}**` to `\u001b[1m{name}\u001b[0m` (ANSI bold codes)
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed - artifact names now display properly in bold within ansi code blocks

2. **Data Migration**: Successfully migrated from original custodian to custodianre
3. **Field Name Fix**: Fixed `breaches` vs `pre_gate_breaches` field mismatch in:
   - thinspace_status command 
   - thinspace_list command
   - setup_setbreaches command
4. **Bowl Command Conflict**: Renamed bowl commands to avoid conflicts:
   - `bowl` (show) → `boww`
   - `bowl` (store) → `bowstore` 
   - Kept `claimbowl` and `listbowl`
5. **File Cleanup**: Removed 297 lines of corrupted/duplicate code and reorganized with proper section headers
6. **Thinspace Status**: Restored original formatting with ANSI colors and multi-column display
